Only in ./an0032_efm32_ethernet/lwip-1.3.1/src/include: lwipopts.h

User header file, configures LWIP library, which features are enabled.

For some reason it has: #include "lwipopts.h", probably a copy-paste error which has no effect.
See also this options file for a different model, it defines different options:
/home/evyatar/tomu-samples/gecko-sdk/Gecko_SDK/hardware/kit/EFM32WG_DK3850/examples/webserver/lwipopts.h


Only in ./an0032_efm32_ethernet/lwip-1.3.1/src: arch

Implements an Ethernet device driver, based on netif/ethernetif.c skeleton.
Implements sys_arch, mostly empty definitions, only file include/arch/cc.h seems to include some useful definitions, for ARM and LWIP GCC defines.
See similar files, for LWIP 1.4 in:

They included sys_arch.h regardless of NO_SYS, which is 1. The original only included this header for NO_SYS 0.

sys_sem_t is uint8_t, not sure why they needed mem_sem global, it doesn't seem to be accessed from any other file.

These changes are not needed, should be overridden anyway by user file src/include/lwipopts.h

Seems useless to me.
